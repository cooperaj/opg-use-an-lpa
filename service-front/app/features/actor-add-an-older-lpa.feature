  As a user
  I expect to be able to add an LPA registered after 31st August 2019 to my account

    And I am a user of the lpa application
    And I am currently signed in

  @acceptance
  Scenario: The user can access the appropriate triage page
    Given I am on the dashboard page
    When I choose to add an LPA
    And I do not have an activation key
    Then I am asked for details from a paper LPA document

  @acceptance
  Scenario: The user can review their answers and can choose to change them
    Given I have chosen to add an LPA without an activation key
    When I provide the details from a valid paper document
    Then I am asked to check my answers are correct
    And I can decide to change my details
